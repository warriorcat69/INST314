## Project 4/5
### This project focuses on the mental health issues one may potentially go through due to our modern society. Ten people were interviewed about their opinions on mental health issues and what might potentially lead to them. This includes mothers, fathers, and children. This was then recorded into an .CSV file which was posted here.
